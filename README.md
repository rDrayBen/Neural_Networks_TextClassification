# Neural_Networks_TextClassification

In this project we experimented with several solutions for the text classification problem for the Fake News dataset from Kaggle(link provided in bert_classification.ipynb and distilbert_classification.ipynb).
For this, we used Bert and DistilBert models from Flair library(bert_classification.ipynb and distilbert_classification.ipynb are only different in the part of classsification model initialization).
As this was a part of Kaggle competition, the accuracy of the soluitons are evaluated by Kaggle system. Results are provided in distilbert_submission.png and bert_submission.png images respectfuly.
